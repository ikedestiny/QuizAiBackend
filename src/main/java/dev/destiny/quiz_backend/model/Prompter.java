            Generate a football quiz in JSON format strictly following this structure:
            {
              "type": "%s",
              "questions": [
                {
                  "question": "[Question text]",
                  "answer": "[Correct answer]",

              "level": "%s"
            }

            Rules:
            1. Generate exactly %d questions.
            2. Each question must have 4 options, one of which is the correct answer.
            3. The difficulty level must be "%s".
            4. Only include factual %s knowledge (no jokes or opinions).
            5. Ensure options are plausible distractors.
            6. Escape special JSON characters.
            7. Do not include any explanations or notesâ€”only pure JSON.
            8. Make sure the response is correct valid json. No extra stuff or introductory text. I am parsing it using a java parser that needs json in the format i gave above
